# Project: Linked Lists

## Part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/linked-lists)

### Created an interactive linked list with a control panel to choose how to interact with the list.
### When session completes, the completed list prints and follows up with data on size, head and tail.
